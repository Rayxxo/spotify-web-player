# spotify-web-player
My own music player UI using Spotify's API/Spotify Web Playback SDK api

A custom Spotify Web Playback SDK project built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Spotify OAuth 2.0 with PKCE
- Web Playback SDK integration
- Custom playlist panel UI
- Track selection with shuffle handling
- Responsive and animated player controls

## Requirements
- Spotify Premium account
- Spotify Developer App
- Client ID (set in the code)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a Spotify Developer App
3. Replace `CLIENT_ID` with your own
4. Serve locally (e.g. Live Server)
5. Login and play music

## Goals

Future goals include:
- Adding playlist selection and seamless switching within the UI
- Enhancing visual feedback and animations tied to playback state
- Exploring the possibility of recreating this project as a desktop application for Windows and a mobile application for supported platforms

## Notes
This project was built as a learning experience to explore real-world API integration and UI state management.
